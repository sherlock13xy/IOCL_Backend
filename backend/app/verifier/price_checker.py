"""
Price Checker for the Hospital Bill Verifier.
Compares bill amounts against tie-up rates and determines verification status.

Pricing logic:
- unit: allowed_amount = rate × quantity
- service: allowed_amount = rate (fixed, quantity ignored)
- bundle: allowed_amount = rate (package price)

Status determination:
- GREEN: bill_amount <= allowed_amount
- RED: bill_amount > allowed_amount (overcharged)
